# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build the Pennywise platform to display brands and virtual assistant providers with contact capabilities.

**Planned changes:**
- Create backend data models for Brands (id, name, description, logo URL) and Virtual Assistant Providers (id, name, description, contact information, payment per client)
- Implement backend methods to add and retrieve brands and providers (providers sorted by payment rate descending)
- Build a frontend page displaying all brands with name, description, and logo
- Build a frontend page displaying virtual assistant providers sorted by payment per client, showing name, description, payment rate, and contact information
- Add contact mechanism for clients to reach providers
- Design a warm, professional visual theme with modern typography and clean layout (avoiding blue and purple colors)

**User-visible outcome:** Users can browse a list of brands with logos and a list of virtual assistant providers ranked by payment rate, and initiate contact with providers through the platform.
